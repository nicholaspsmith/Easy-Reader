Link Gatherer
=======

A simple chrome extension that takes all of the links out of the body of an article, placing them at the bottom. I created this to improve the readability of articles and prevent myself from falling into link rabbit-holes.

How to use
--------
Just chill out. Once I get the bugs worked out I will put it on the Chrome Web Store. (For free of course)

If you really want to mess around with it, then go ahead and clone it down, fire up Chrome, and do the following:

+ Navigate to chrome://extensions/
* Check 'Developer mode'
- Click on 'Load unpacked extension...'
* Select the folder containing the plugin files
+ Navigate to an [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/ultima-viii-pagan-free/) and read in peace
* Smile :)
